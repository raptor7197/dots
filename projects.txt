DSA : 
GPU accelerated data structures and algorithms
about : General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is increasingly applied in data processing systems and applications. The high degree of parallelism, coupled with memory bandwidth that surpasses that of any CPU, and high-performance interconnects with speeds in the Terabyte/s range make GPUs attractive for large-volume data analytics and to accelerate data processing tasks beyond Artificial Intelligence. 
tools : Experience in indexing and compression algorithms.
Experience in HPC networking (i.e., RDMA) and libraries (e.g., MPI, NCCL, NVSHMEM).
Experience using NVIDIA profiling tools.


What if you could 𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫… for your code?
I built exactly that. 👇
⚡ P2P Code Executor
Write Python/JS on your machine → it executes on ANY connected peer’s PC → you get the result instantly.
No AWS.
 No servers.
 No cloud bills.
 𝐉𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐑𝐓𝐂 𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐜.

🔧 Tech stack
Electron → system-level access
WebRTC → peer-to-peer execution
Socket.IO → signaling & setup
This is what distributed computing should feel like:
Simple. Fast. Free.
Basically: Use your friend’s PC like it’s your own.


sudoku solved q quantum algorithms 

a search engine and if possible make it running on 1mb ram and also see of we can make it run on the least amount of ram possible 

room based cat application (witk possible e2e ans destroying room capabilities)
websockets and also privacy things and deploy it (?)

Real time collaborative platform (figma clone from scratch and canvas or maybe an excali draw typa thing)

Semantic search engive for a custom dataset (glorified RAG)

Stock market similator(just front end animations nothign else)

Code editor with a browser side by side where ADHD people and has auto scrolling technologies,
name : codecafe to watch reels and also to read docs or something
make it like a mini windo typa thing
